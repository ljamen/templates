## Before You Begin
Make sure the user understands what needs to be in place BEFORE they start. Also, make sure that the user knows what the project will NOT cover. For example, if there is an assumption that the user is already familiar with the master project, state that and provide a link. Most of our services will be for advanced users.

* Dependencies

List dependencies on other projects, apps, configurations, etc.

* Prerequisites

Installations, versions of apps, etc. that should already be in place. 

* What is a (common feature/component/concept)?

Here you can describe the basic terms or functions that the user will need to understand before starting a project.
DO NOT repeat open source doc that is covered in another repository. Link to that info. This is terminology that is specific to this project or used in a different/specific way.

## Get Started or Quickstart
Provide the basic steps required to get a simple program running (Hello-World). Describe what the module looks like in action. Do not rely on screenshots to tell the story. Be descriptive, include examples but be brief. Link to secondary examples if complicated.

```
Give examples
Include the example code in Usage as a file in your repo -- maybe as example.js. Users should be able to run if they clone the repository.
```


## Install

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```
## Build
If applicable for your project

## Deploy

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
(NOTE: this could link to a separate file if complicated or lengthy)

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo (Again this should probably be in a separate file.)

## Test 

<Optional>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. 
link to separate testing file if complicated
